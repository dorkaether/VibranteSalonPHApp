**Vibrante Salon PH** is an advertisement application made for iOS devices, written in Objective-C and Swift.

This application is made for the subject code **ITE 237 - Advanced Programming I**. This is nothing but a final project app to pass the class. If you somehow managed to find this repository *without* knowing me (Finn / Kiwi / Erin) and/or this class, I applaud you. You're free to look if you want, I guess.

If, however, you find this one because you have the link - then welcome.

This repository's main purpose is to *keep track of the progress made* for this application, and to ease the compiling of codes between partners. For a less-than-obvious reason, for storage in case of... well, corrupted files.

## !! NEW UPDATE !! 08-15-22
Changelog:

[![UPDATE: Milestone Reached!](https://img.shields.io/badge/UPDATE-Milestone%20Reached!-blue)](https://github.com/dorkaether/VibranteSalonPHApp#-new-update-) **Application Finished!**

So... hi.

I decided to make some changes here, namely the whole readme because I am, once again, enrolled to IT - but in a different school (five points to the person who makes the connection what school I came from and and where I came back to-). To the people that is probably confused, once upon a time I was a very high esteemed student. Life got in the way, and this project was my only connection (at that time) to the outside world, hanging on by a single thin thread.

The thread snapped when I passed this class, not because I deserved it but rather out of pity, ending forever who was known to be the 'coding god'. No, I am not exaggerating.

I am not saying I regret taking this class. If I would be honest, I learned a lot. It made me appreciate the developers that make mobile applications on iOS because it is very hard - but the process of it I had fun. I also learned, that it is okay to have references. Not really copying but also not really being original. Life is art - we reference everything. There is no one who is original in their work, it just only seemed that way because some people decided to push forward and present that work to the eyes of the public. No one is copying anyone else unless it is exactly the same - step by step.

This one is full of references, I admit, but the whole code here was typed by our own hands - yes, ours! This project was made by duo Finn (me, I refuse to put my deadname in this update) and Marvin.

Why is it here, the project? To make it as a resource for budding new programmers. I always do that, on my old GitHub account that I can't seem to access anymore ([dracaether, which is here by the way if you want more references](https://github.com/dracaether) - I will probably migrate them all here at some point so I will keep that link up until I revamp everything here). The dots and shell files are my linux-related stuff, I don't think you would want to touch those unless you're a linux (or arguably a mac?) user? Anyways.

*God, this is becoming more of a full blown essay than what I needed to say...*

Anyways, this is the start of a new dawn. I hope I can survive it this time. 화이팅!

## I. Project Description

The application’s purpose is to, well, advertise.

Aside from being blunt, the actual reason of the application’s existence is to advertise a *salon*. In most cases, people would probably advertise something akin to a restaurant, or a cafe, or maybe even a hotel or catering. While sure, there’s other places out there that can be advertised, these are the most common. Thus, this idea was born after a few minutes of consideration.

The application is expected to inform the user of the salon, and with all the information and details they wanted to know, hopefully they will consider having their next haircut at Vibrante Salon.

As for the user experience, we plan on making it as simple as we can considering the age range while keeping it’s elegant style scheme based on their colors – white, gold and black. Eventually, the application will be easy to navigate while having enough information at their fingertips – with buttons large enough to be tapped on but small enough not to ruin the symmetrical form of the whole design.
