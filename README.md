**Vibrante Salon PH** is an advertisement application made for iOS devices, written in Objective-C and Swift.

This application is made for the subject code **ITE 237 - Advanced Programming I**. This is nothing but a final project app to pass the class. If you somehow managed to find this repository *without* knowing me (Finn / Kiwi / Erin) and/or this class, I applaud you. You're free to look if you want, I guess.

If, however, you find this one because you have the link - then welcome.

This repository's main purpose is to *keep track of the progress made* for this application, and to ease the compiling of codes between partners. For a less-than-obvious reason, for storage in case of... well, corrupted files.

## !! NEW UPDATE !!
Changelog:

[![UPDATE: Milestone Reached!](https://img.shields.io/badge/UPDATE-Milestone%20Reached!-blue)](https://github.com/dorkaether/VibranteSalonPHApp#-new-update-) **Application Finished!**

An open letter to the reader, the interested, the friend, and the professor:

After this project, I realized that while I do like programming, it isn't for me.

A little history - my interest in computers started back when I was a child, but the only reason at that time was *it's a new thing!!!* and me being curious wanted to try it out. After a week, I have probably know a lot compared to my parents at the time and what gained my interest was games.

I discovered Linux in 2012, and while I was content doing small shell scripts and making the OS my own (and most of my knowledge was thanks to Arch), I didn't really think that I would go beyond that. After 3 years of dabbling with programming languages, I can safetly say that I know Shell, C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and finally Swift; at least the most basic functions.

However, as I said I never dreamed on going this far. Computers are my hobby and I think they'll always be my hobby.

If you haven't realized it by now, this is a goodbye letter to Programming; at least to the track. I joined this track back when Animation was dissolved and I was already content at that time - but I had to pick either Web Dev't or this. I had no interest in Web, so here I am.

Programming, I stayed with you for like a semester. Before that, I had C++, Python and Java. I had fun, really I do; but I can't take the stress, the late nights working on a code - *people relying on me, telling me I was a coding god and I should know what I am doing*.

For three years I barely drew - half the reason because I decided to focus on you. The other half? My own parents, once upon a time, told me that I can't be an artist, for I will never earn money in doing so.

All my life I wanted to be an artist, an animator. I rather tell my stories through pictures instead of words.

Yes I may be somewhat decent when it comes to fine arts, yeah I may not be a good artist when it comes to realistic styles. But I have fun drawing. I *still* have fun drawing without a care in a world and what would people think.

Another reason why I can't invest in Programming anymore: My stresses in life is still haunting me.

I wanted to escape life so bad, and I almost succeeded it too; mais j'ai promis à ma princesse...

Programmation! Merci pour tout... mais il est temps pour moi de partir. c:

And here's the time that I leave this project to my partner, Marvin Son. While this repo will stay up and still stay under my name, he now fully owns it. 

Marvin, merci beaucoup. Thank you very much. You're a good kid, not a bad partner. You tried your best and we pulled through! I'm sorry that this is the time we part, I hope whatever you learned during the development of our application, you know which is right and wrong to do. I know we should definitely stop using images hahaha!

But this is the end, thank you for reading.

## I. Project Description

The application’s purpose is to, well, advertise.

Aside from being blunt, the actual reason of the application’s existence is to advertise a *salon*. In most cases, people would probably advertise something akin to a restaurant, or a cafe, or maybe even a hotel or catering. While sure, there’s other places out there that can be advertised, these are the most common. Thus, this idea was born after a few minutes of consideration.

The application is expected to inform the user of the salon, and with all the information and details they wanted to know, hopefully they will consider having their next haircut at Vibrante Salon.

As for the user experience, we plan on making it as simple as we can considering the age range while keeping it’s elegant style scheme based on their colors – white, gold and black. Eventually, the application will be easy to navigate while having enough information at their fingertips – with buttons large enough to be tapped on but small enough not to ruin the symmetrical form of the whole design.
