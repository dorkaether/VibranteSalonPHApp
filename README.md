**Vibrante Salon PH** is an advertisement application made for iOS devices, written in Swift.

This application is made for the subject code **ITE 237 - Advanced Programming I**. This is nothing but a final project app to pass the class. If you somehow managed to find this repository *without* knowing me (Dorky) and/or this class, I applaud you. You're free to look if you want, I guess.

If, however, you find this one because you have the link - then welcome.

This repository's main purpose is to *keep track of the progress made* for this application, and to ease the compiling of codes between partners. For a less-than-obvious reason, for storage in case of... well, corrupted files.

### I. Project Description

The application’s purpose is to, well, advertise.

Aside from being blunt, the actual reason of the application’s existence is to advertise a *salon*. In most cases, people would probably advertise something akin to a restaurant, or a cafe, or maybe even a hotel or catering. While sure, there’s other places out there that can be advertised, these are the most common. Thus, this idea was born after a few minutes of consideration.

The application is expected to inform the user of the salon, and with all the information and details they wanted to know, hopefully they will consider having their next haircut at Vibrante Salon.

As for the user experience, we plan on making it as simple as we can considering the age range while keeping it’s elegant style scheme based on their colors – white, gold and black. Eventually, the application will be easy to navigate while having enough information at their fingertips – with buttons large enough to be tapped on but small enough not to ruin the symmetrical form of the whole design.

### II. Potential Users

The developers based this app to the age range of at least 14-60+ years, depending on their knowledge in using an application, or in general – a smartphone. While this may be a bit of a stretch but there’s probably people beyond this age range who may be interested in applications such as this.
